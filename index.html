        <h2>Welcome!</h2>
        <p>
            I am a private English teacher from the United States with more than 6 years
            experience and CELTA certification. I am also fluent in Brazilian Portuguese,
            which helps a lot in understanding the needs of all Latin language speakers
            (Portuguese, Spanish, French, Italian.)
        </p>
        <p>
            I teach all levels of general English and have experience with all kinds of students,
            from complete beginners to advanced learners. I love teaching all aspects of English, 
            but my passion is working on pronunciation with my students.
        </p>
        <p>
            All my classes are online now because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but that doesn't
            affect the way I try to make them fun and dynamic. If you want to see for yourself,
            you can take a placement test right here on the site and book a half hour
            demo class.
