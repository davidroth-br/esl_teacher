                <p>
                    ‘Heavier than air flying machines are impossible,’ said the well-known scientist
                    Lord Kelvin in 1895. Thomas Watson, the chairman of IBM in 1943, was wrong too
                    when he said that he thought there would be a world market for only five or so computers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Predictions can, of course, be wrong, and it is very difficult to predict what the world
                    will be like in 100, 50, or even 20 years from now. But this is something that scientists
                    and politicians often do. They do so because they invent things and make decisions that
                    <b><em>shape</em></b> the future of the world that we live in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the past they didn’t have to think too much about the impact that their decisions had
                    on the natural world. But that is now changing. An increasing number of people believe
                    that we should live within the rules set by nature. In other words, they think that in a
                    world of fixed and limited resources, what is used today will not be there for our children.
                    We must therefore look at each human activity and try to change it or create alternatives if
                    it is not sustainable. The rules for this are set by nature, not by man.

                <p>
                    Many hotel chains and tour operators say that they take their environmental commitments seriously,
                    but often they do not respect their social and economic responsibilities to the local community.
                    So, is it possible for travellers to help improve the lives of locals and still have a good holiday?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The charity, Tourism Concern, thinks so. It has pioneered the concept of the fair-trade holiday.
                    The philosophy behind fair-trade travel is to make sure that local people get a fair share of the
                    income from tourism. The objectives are simple: employing local people wherever possible; offering
                    fair wages and treatment; showing cultural respect; involving communities in deciding how tourism
                    is developed; and making sure that visitors have minimal environmental impact.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although there is currently no official fair-trade accreditation for holidays, the Association of
                    Independent Tour Operators has worked hard to produce responsible tourism guidelines for its members.
                    Some new companies, operated as much by principles as profits, offer a fantastic range of holidays for
                    responsible and adventurous travellers.

                <p>
                    Standards of spelling and grammar among an entire generation of English-speaking university students
                    are now so poor that there is ‘a degree of crisis’ in their written use of the language, the publisher
                    of a new dictionary has warned. Its research revealed that students have only a limited <b><em>grasp</em></b> of the
                    most basic rules of spelling, punctuation and meaning, blamed in part on an increasing dependence on
                    ‘automatic tools’ such as computer spellcheckers and unprecedented access to rapid communication using
                    e-mail and the Internet. The problem is not confined to the US, but applies also to students in Australia,
                    Canada and Britain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Students were regularly found to be producing incomplete or rambling, poorly connected sentences, mixing
                    metaphors ‘with gusto’ and overusing dull, devalued words such as ‘interesting’ and ‘good’. Overall they
                    were unclear about appropriate punctuation, especially the use of commas, and failed to understand the
                    basic rules of subject/verb agreement and the difference between ‘there’, ‘their’ and ‘they’re’.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Kathy Rooney, editor-in-chief of the dictionary, said, ‘We need to be very concerned at the extent of the
                    problems with basic spelling and usage that our research has revealed. This has significant implications
                    for the future, especially for young people. We thought it would be useful to get in touch with teachers
                    and academics to find out what problems their students were having with their writing and what extra help
                    they might need from a dictionary. The results were quite shocking. We are sure that the use of computers
                    has played a part. People rely increasingly on automatic tools such as spellcheckers that are much more
                    passive than going to a dictionary and looking something up. That can lull <b><em>them</em></b> into a false sense of security.’
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beth Marshall, an English professor, said, ‘The type of student we’re getting now is very different from
                    what we were seeing 10 years ago and it is often worrying to find out how little students know. There are
                    as many as 800 commonly misspelled words, particularly pairs of words that are pronounced similarly but
                    spelled differently and that have different meanings – for example, “faze” and “phase”, and “pray” and “prey”.’
